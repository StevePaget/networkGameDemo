# networkGameDemo
 
This is a demo game of Noughts and Crosses (Tic Tac Toe), which has been designed to aid students creating a network game for multiple players.
This example allows two players on different computers to play against each other.

I have tried to structure the game and provide comments so that you could adapt the network communication elements to apply to a variety of different games.
It will work best with games which have a turn-based structure, rather than where both players act simultaneously. Examples would include simple card games, board games etc.

The example game uses a library called pygame_functions. This is my own library which takes care of drawing on a graphical screen and mouse inputs, simplifying the process of drawing in pygame. You can find out more about pygame_function here: https://github.com/StevePaget/Pygame_Functions/wiki
